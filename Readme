Summary
==============================================================
In order to setting CentOS7 system and install application softwares faster,alse in
order to achieve time saving.I writ these two scripts,getSudoPermission.sh and
setup.sh.
These package only fit CentOS7,for other Linux system,you should modify them.


parameter
==============================================================
These two scripts need three parameteres when execute.
The first parameter is your user name.
The second parameter must is a digital,it will control the time of the install loop.
The third paramenter will decide whether upgrade or update your system,upgrade will be execute when 
you give parameter "upgrade",and upgrade and update will all be execute when you give parameter as update.
For he forth parameter,if you want to redirect output to a file,you should set this
parameter like "-y",otherwise,you should set it with "-n".
These four parameter like:
#./getPermission.sh Tom 2 upgrate -y
$sudo ./setup.sh Tom 2 upgrate -y
or like:
#./getPermission.sh Tom 2 NoUpdate -y
$sudo ./setup.sh Tom 2 NoUpdate -y


using
==============================================================
After download this package and unzip it,you should authorization permission first
like following:
$su
#chmod +x ./getPermission.sh ./setup.sh

Then you can run these two scripts.If your using user can run command "sudo",
you can execute setup.sh directly,like:
$sudo ./setup.sh Tom 2 upgrate -y
otherwise,you shuould execute getPermission.sh first using root permission,like:
$su
#./getPermission.sh Tom 2 -y
when the command done,you should exit root permisson,like:
#exit
then,you can execute setup.sh,like:
$sudo ./setup.sh Tom 2 upgrate -y


Remind:
==============================================================
If you want to accelerate your computer's internet speed,you can try to run "installBBR.sh".
BBR is a accelerator,the algorithm of bbr was developed by google and every user said that bbr
brought a very good experence. In my experence,I installed BBR on my VPS,that I can watch
4K video on Youtube and it was very fluency.Additionally,I watch Youtube by ShadowsocksR.
To install BBR:
$sudo chmod +x ./installBBR.sh
$sudo ./installBBR.sh

After installed BBR,you should reboot your system to make BBR effective.
You can use bellow commands to check whether BBR have been installed.

$uname -r
####This command used check the version of you Linux OS kernel.If the information printed
contain "4.9.0" or above,it shows that kernel updated successfully.

$sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_available_congestion_control
###If the output information contain "bbr",it shows OK.

$sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_congestion_control
###If the output information contain "bbr",it shows OK.

$lsmod | grep bbr
###If the output information likes "tcp_bbr                20480  11",it shows OK.

If all above shows OK, congratulations on the success of your installation.




Notice:
==============================================================
After you installed BBR,it is possible that your system can't start.Then you can try to
modify grub or reinstall your OS.
